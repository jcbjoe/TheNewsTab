Want to view the news while browsing the web, or love the Microsoft News Tab but hate the adverts or weird articles it recommends? Then The News Tab extension is for you! A simple new tab that provides you with the news you want to see!

The News Tab extension was inspired by the new tab page for Microsoft Edge and their extension, Microsoft News Page. However this extension allows you to choose what RSS feeds are shown and doesn't display adverts!
